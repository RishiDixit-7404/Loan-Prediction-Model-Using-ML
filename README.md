# 🏦 Loan Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based solution for predicting the loan approval status of applicants based on various features like income, credit history, education, and more. It was created as part of the AML (Applied Machine Learning) Course Assignment.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Loan_Train.csv`. It contains anonymized information on loan applicants, including:

- Gender  
- Marital Status  
- Number of Dependents  
- Education  
- Self-Employment status  
- Income details  
- Loan amount  
- Loan term  
- Credit history  
- Property area  
- Loan status (target variable)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

## 🧠 ML Techniques

The following steps were used in the machine learning workflow:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Feature scaling  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visual analysis of variables  
   - Understanding feature correlation  

3. **Model Building**
   - Train-test split  
   - Training multiple classifiers:  
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Decision Tree  
     - Random Forest  
     - Support Vector Machine  
     - K-Nearest Neighbors  

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy score  
   - Confusion matrix  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score  

## ✅ Results

After comparing models, the one with the best accuracy and generalization performance was selected as the final model.
